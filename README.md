# Face Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV, allowing you to detect faces either through a webcam or an IP camera feed from your smartphone.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Run the `face_detection.py` script:

```
python face_detection.py
```

2. The script will launch a window displaying the video feed from your camera, with rectangles drawn around detected faces.

3. Press 'q' to quit the application.

## Configuration

- If you want to use a webcam, ensure it's connected to your machine. The script will automatically detect and use the webcam.
- If you want to use your smartphone camera, edit the `smart_phone_camera_ip_address` variable in the script with the IP address and video stream URL of your smartphone camera.
